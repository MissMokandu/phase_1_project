# Car types knowledge site
## Description
This is a straightforward web application built for new car buyers. It's a single page that presents various car types (like sedans, SUVs, hatchbacks, and electric vehicles) with rich details including images, key features, and tables comparing their advantages and disadvantages. What's neat is that all this car data is fetched live from a local source and displayed using JavaScript. You can actively search and filter the car types, and even interact with each car listing to uncover more information.
## Learning Goals
-Develop skills in modifying the Document Object   Model (DOM) through the programmatic generation and insertion of HTML elements.
-Construct a complete client-side application that operates seamlessly on a single page, eliminating full page refreshes.
-Gain experience in asynchronous data retrieval by leveraging the fetch() API to interact with JSON-based external data sources.
